# Stacked_Autoencoders
This recommender system is not confined to predicting binary ratings (0 or 1)
- Range of ratings ( 1 to 5 ) of the movies is predicted by this unsupervised Deep learning model which makes it more robust
- Built with PyTorch library ( a very powerful one used by the researchers across the globe ) 

#### Dataset used : MovieLens 100K movie ratings ( https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/ ) 

##### Will be testing on other datasets with different parameter settings very soon !!
